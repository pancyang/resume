  <p>I'm in the research industry, focusing on research topics related to sustainability.<br>If you've wished to streamline your business, <a href="contacts.html">email me</a> and I can assist.</p>
  <p>Currently, I am working under a grant project which aim to develop biodegradable and stimuli responsive polymers and encapsulates for care chemical applications.<br>
    An important aspect to this project is ensuring the sustainability of our polymers to the Environment.<br>
    My main role is to perform Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) to analyze the potential environmental profiles of the synthesis routes and provide advice on process optimization.</p>
  <p>From 2016 to 2017, I worked on an industry project in collaboration with GlaxoSmithKline (GSK).<br>
    Together with my team, we developed a decision support system for design of pharmaceutical supply chain and won The Sustainable Technology Award in 2017 IChemE Singapore Awards.<br>
